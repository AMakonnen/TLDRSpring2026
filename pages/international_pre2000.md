## International Book Bans Before 2000 ##

<sup> Alexander, Hannah, Leeza, Ryan </sup>

International book bans prior to the 21st century are often characterized by political dissent and religious heresy, with China, India, and Singapore responsible for the highest percentages of global book bans. According to reports from federal governments (although the actual percentages are likely much higher), Asian countries are responsible for nearly 44% of recorded book bans worldwide, with an additional 33% of bans occurring in Europe. North America accounts for 7.41% of bans, and South America accounts for only 2.38% of bans (Curcic). 

Book banning started as early as 212 B.C when the Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang burned all the books in his kingdom in order to control the writing of history of his time. Although this connection between censorship and control persists today, the justifications for banning books have expanded. Up to the 21st century, censorship shifted from suppressing historical writings to restricting diversity in religious writings, preserving social order, and protecting youth from material considered to be inappropriate (“Freedom To Read”).

The most widely banned book has historically been the Bible. This is due to certain countries outlawing Christianity (Roman Empire, Islamic State, Communist State), editing Bible to make them more "correct"/"suitable (Catholic Roman Empire, Jim Crow America), and still others who view certain books as outside of the accepted canon (Urban 1).
