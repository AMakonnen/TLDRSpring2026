## International Book Bans 2000-2026 ##

<sup> Yasmine, Avery, Andrew, Allison </sup>

In the 21st century, as access to books has increased through various technological advancements, so has the rate at which books are banned. This century so far has seen a sharp increase in the number of books banned worldwide from the already substantial amount banned in the 20th century, with the US, Russia, Bangladesh, and China being some of the main culprits. In fact, the first 25 years of the 21st century alone are responsible for 16.62% of all book bannings (Curcic). The books banned tend to be those who conflict with certain societal or government values, such as books with themes rooted in racial or LGBTQIA+ ideas, political dissent, or diverse social values. For example, a book like _Animal Farm_ was banned in Russia for satirizing the communist government, while a book like _Little Black Sambo_ was banned in Japan to quell political threats to boycott Japanese cultural exports.

Importantly, the types of books countries ban depend heavily on national agendas and goals. The desire for homogenization and increased government control over foreign ideas may play a part in this. For instance, China and Russia tend to ban any books with beliefs that don’t adhere to their respective political narratives (Tzabiras). This can have dramatic effects on the populations and governments of these countries, often affecting multiple generations across decades and sometimes centuries. People may be less open to foreign perspectives and worldviews.
