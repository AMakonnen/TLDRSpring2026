## What is a Book Ban? ##

<sup> Mahammad, Adela, Qianru, Josh </sup>

Book banning is any instance of an institution (government body, school district, library, or other authority) removing or restricting access to a book (or books) from a group of people. 

Historically, book banning has been used by governments. religious groups, and educational institutions, with the intent to protect the reader or provide control of mass thought to the banner. A well-noted example of an act contributing to both intents is the Roman Catholic Church’s Index Librorum Prohibitum (List of prohibited books), which served an intent both in favor of the reader by keeping immoral content away from the masses and the banning institution by restricting criticism against the church and religion (Britannica).

Today, book banning is common in public school districts and prisons. In school districts, books are often removed if deemed likely to harm young readers. This especially includes books that include sexual content. In prisons, the aim is different. The goal of censorship in prisons is often to maintain the “order” of the prison, so books with ideas related to uprising or breaking the general order of society are banned to prevent inmates from adopting those ideas. For example, Robert Greene’s “48 Laws of Power” is the second-most-banned book in prisons (Marquis).  The commonly cited reason is that it contains manipulative content that goes against the order in prisons. 

Book banning remains a double-edged sword that can protect youth from contacting harmful information, and it can also be a tool for authoritative entities to control thoughts and implement censorship. While supporters of bans argue that they protect students from harmful or age-inappropriate material, critics contend that banning books limits intellectual freedom and restricts access to diverse perspectives and experiences. 
Therefore, book banning is a topic of controversy for many. It shows that books, as media that carry knowledge, are political and initiate many discussions surrounding the question of: who can have access to certain knowledge fields? Should all knowledge be free to access?
